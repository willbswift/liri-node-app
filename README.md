# liri-node-app
This is the ReadMe file for my LIRI node program. It was the assignment for the 10th week at Web Developer Bootcamp. LIRI stands for Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.  LIRI will search Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for information on movies.

To use it one needs to run "node liri" in git-bash.  There are three available commands.  

"concert-this" followed by a band name or singer name results in a list of the upcoming concerts that that group/artist is appearing at.

"movie-this" followed by a movie title results in several pieces of information about that film from IMDB.  If no movie title is provided it defaults to giving the details of the film "Mr. Nobody."

"do-what-it-says" pulls the text from the random.txt file and follows those instructions.  In this case it provides information on my favorite movie, however the text in random can be altered so that other responses can be achieved.
